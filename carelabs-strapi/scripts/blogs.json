        "content": "Harmonics are produced by non-linear loads that absorb non-sinusoidal current. These non-sinusoidal currents contain harmonic currents that interact with the impedance of the power distribution system to create voltage distortion that can affect both the distribution system equipment and the loads connected to it. The most common loads, both in industrial surroundings and domestic ones, that can cause harmonics are:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Frequency / Variable speed drives</li>\n \t<li>Discharge lamps (high pressure sodium vapour lamp, mercury vapour lamp, low consumption, fluorescent, etc.)</li>\n \t<li>Rectifiers</li>\n \t<li>AC/DC Converters</li>\n \t<li>Arc welding</li>\n \t<li>Induction ovens</li>\n \t<li>UPS</li>\n \t<li>Computers and laptops</li>\n</ul>\nA load is believed to be non-linear if its impedance varies with the operated voltage. Because of this varying impedance, the current pulled by the non-linear load is also non-linear that is non-sinusoidal in nature, even when it is connected to a sinusoidal voltage source.\n<h2><strong>Why Voltage Harmonic Study and Analysis Important?</strong></h2>\nThe existence of harmonics doesn’t mean that the factory cannot run appropriately. Like other power quality phenomena, it depends on the stiffness of the power distribution system and the susceptibility of the equipment. There are numerous types of equipment that can have failures or mis-operations because of high harmonic voltage and/or current levels. This harmonic pollution is frequently send back onto the electric utility distribution system and might affect amenities on the same system which are more vulnerable.\n<h3><strong>Few effects of voltage harmonics are:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Incorrect reading meters,</li>\n \t<li>Reduced true PF, where PF= Watts/VA.</li>\n \t<li>Overheated transformers will circulate in the primary side.</li>\n \t<li>Zero, negative sequence voltages on motors and generators.</li>\n \t<li>Nuisance operation of protective devices, consists of false tripping of relays and letdown of a UPS to transfer properly.</li>\n \t<li>Blown fuses on PF correction caps because of high currents and voltage from resonance with line impedance.</li>\n \t<li>Mis-operation or failure of electronic equipment</li>\n \t<li>The effect on lighting is called flicker, if there are voltage subharmonics in the range of 1-30Hz.</li>\n \t<li>Distortion of unwanted currents, main supply voltage flowing in the supply network generate additional energy losses.</li>\n \t<li>Disturbed operation of florescent lamps, defective operation of regulating devices, television receivers or other equipment.</li>\n \t<li>Malfunction of ripple control and other mains signaling systems, protective relays and, possibly, other of control systems.</li>\n \t<li>Telephone interference.</li>\n \t<li>High harmonic amplitudes may not only cause malfunctions, additional losses and overheating, but also overload the power distribution network and overheat the neutral conductor and cause it to burn out.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>What is Done During Voltage Harmonics Study and Analysis?</strong></h2>\nThe quantity of voltage harmonics will mostly be influenced by the source impedance, which includes all of the wiring and transformers back to the source of the electricity and the amount of harmonic currents being pulled by the load. Ohm’s Law is true for harmonic values as well. A “stiff” system, that is if the source harmonic impedance is very low, then the harmonic currents will result in lower harmonic voltages than if the source impedance were high.\n\n<strong><u>Fourier Series:</u></strong> The analysis of harmonics is the means of computing the phases and magnitudes of the high order and fundamental harmonics of the periodic waveforms. The resulting series is known as Fourier series. It establishes a relation between a function in the domain of time and a function in the domain of frequency.\n\nThe Fourier’s theorem states that every non-sinusoidal periodic wave can be decomposed as the sum of sine waves through the application of the Fourier series, given the following conditions:\n<ul>\n \t<li>The integral over one period of the function is a finite value.</li>\n \t<li>The function possesses a finite number of discontinuities in a period.</li>\n \t<li>The function possesses a finite number of maxima and minima in a period.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>The Fourier series of a periodic function x(t) is expressed as:</strong>\n\nThis constitutes a representation of periodic function in the domain of the frequency.\n\nIn this expression, a0 is the average value of the function x(t), where an and bn are the coefficients of the series besides being the rectangular components of the n harmonic. For the subsequent n harmonic its vector is:\n\nWith a an angle of phase and magnitude:\n<h3>The main sources of harmonics are:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Arc furnaces and other elements of arc discharge, such as fluorescent lamps. Arc furnaces are considered as voltage harmonic generators more than current generators. Usually, all harmonics surface but the odd harmonics are predominant with typical values with regard to the fundamental harmonic:</li>\n \t<li>The third harmonic represents 20%, and the fifth harmonic represents 10%.</li>\n \t<li>The seventh harmonic represents 6%, and the ninth harmonic represents 3%.</li>\n \t<li>Magnetic cores in rotating machines and transformers need 3rd harmonic current to stimulate the iron.</li>\n \t<li>The inrush current of transformers produces second and fourth harmonics.</li>\n \t<li>Adjustable speed controllers used in fans, pumps, and process controllers.</li>\n \t<li>Solid‐state switches which modulate control currents, light intensity, heat, etc.</li>\n \t<li>Controlled sources for electronic equipment.</li>\n \t<li>Rectifiers based on diodes and thyristors for welding equipment, battery chargers, etc.</li>\n \t<li>Static reactive power compensators.</li>\n \t<li>DC high voltage transmission stations.</li>\n \t<li>AC to DC converters (inverters).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How is Voltage Harmonic Study and Analysis Performed?</h2>\nIEEE 519 was initially introduced in 1981 as an “IEEE Guide for Harmonic Control and Reactive Compensation of Static Power Converters”. According to the revised 1992 version of IEEE 519 standard, the industrial system is responsible for controlling the harmonic currents created in the industrial workplace.\n\n<strong>Following are the steps in voltage harmonic analysis of power transformer:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Draw the single line diagram of electrical installation</li>\n \t<li>Determine the characteristic of power transformer</li>\n \t<li>Indicate the load distribution</li>\n \t<li>Distortioners</li>\n \t<li>Non-distortioners</li>\n \t<li>Identify the measuring points and define each measuring points</li>\n \t<li>Determine whether the level of work demanded during measurements is known</li>\n \t<li>If yes, carry out measurements.</li>\n \t<li>If no, consult the owner</li>\n \t<li>Carry out the measurement for</li>\n \t<li>Supply/PCC: Check battery and note power. Perform the measurement with and without battery connected.</li>\n \t<li>Critical secondary switch boards: Determine the number of loads. Measure the neutral current and current imbalance.</li>\n \t<li>Distortioning loads: perform measurement on load. Perform measurement of different work regimes</li>\n \t<li>Interpret the data measured, aiming to recognize the effects harmonics produce on them.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Hand-held Harmonic</strong> meters are used for performing spot checks for known harmonic problems. However, harmonic values will often change during the day, as different loads are turned on and off within the facility or in other facilities on the same electric utility distribution system. This requires the use of a harmonic monitor or power quality monitor with harmonic capabilities, which can record the harmonic values over a period of time.\n\n<strong>Harmonic Analysis Software</strong> can be used to simulate harmonic voltage sources and current, decrease nuisance trips, recognize harmonic problems, design and test filters, and report harmonic current and voltage distortion limit violations.\n\nComprehensive load flow and frequency scan calculations are performed using detailed harmonic source models and power system component frequency models. Outcomes are represented graphically involving harmonic spectrum plots, harmonic order and harmonic waveform plots.\n\nIt is essential to follow the procedure for the study of the analysis of harmonic disturbance, if we omit any of the steps, the measurement and study process will be very complicating and, in many cases, we will be unable to give a possible solution to our solution.\n\n<strong>In short, the following should be carried out: </strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Define the objective of the study</li>\n \t<li>An electrical drawing of the installation and how the loads are distributed.</li>\n \t<li>To define measurement points and to identify them in the drawing</li>\n \t<li>Load level during measuring</li>\n \t<li>Interpret the data calculated trying to identify the effects of the harmonics and based on what the directive, standard or regulation establishes.</li>\n</ul>\nAfter the diagnosis and the assessment of the disturbances we move onto the treatment or solution. We must always look for a balance between the technical solution and the economic one. The ideal technical solution will be to filter directly the disturbing avoiding the propagation of the harmonic currents against other loads and installation, and a greater drop in harmonic voltage which would provoke the distortion of the voltage wave. In other cases, the solution is to look for a solution as near as possible to the loads.",

        "content": "<em><strong>Carelabs is authorized provider of Electrical Installation's Study, Analysis, Inspection, and Certification services in UAE, and offer unbalanced load flow study and analysis services.</strong></em>\n\nLoad flow analysis is an important function for power system planning and practical studies. Certain applications, particularly in distribution automation and optimization of a power system, require repeated load flow solution and in these applications, it is very important to solve the load flow problem as efficiently as possible.\n\nAs the power distribution networks become more complex, there is greater demand for efficient and reliable system operation. Consequently, the most important system analysis tool, load flow studies, should be capable of handling various system configurations with adequate accuracy and speed.\n\nIn several situations, it observed that the radial distribution systems remain unbalanced due to single-phase, two-phase and three-phase loads. Thus, load flow solution for unbalanced case, special analysis is necessary.\n\nUsual load flow method cannot directly apply to distribution systems. The mode used for three phase power flow analysis in unbalanced systems cannot develop by extending the single phase balanced methods. A three-phase load flow method has to analyze problems like modeling of different forms of fundamental connections that would regulate starting point for three phase power flow solution as there are phase shifts and transformation ratios for each phase and at different buses. For un-transposed lines and cables the balanced models are no longer useful.\n\nThe symmetrical component transformation can decouple the three phases. For three phase networks burden matrix obtain. A method to measure power losses in unbalanced radial distribution systems.\n<h2>How to Model the Transformer for Power Flow Analysis.</h2>\n<h3>Fast Decoupled Power Flow Method for Unbalanced Radial Distribution Systems</h3>\nThis method prefers the laterals instead of buses into layers, it would decrease the problem size to the number of laterals. Using lateral variable rather than bus variable makes this methods adequate for given system topology, however it may add some obstacle if the network topology changed frequently, which is common in distribution systems because of switching operations. Finding three-phase radial distribution networks. This method uses the forward and backward propagation to measure branch currents and bus voltages.\n\nThe three-phase Current Injection Method, injection equations written in rectangular regulates full Newton method. Also it shows quadratic convergence properties and convergence obtained for all except some conditioned cases. This uses G-matrix for power flow based on equal current injections. The Network Topology which uses two matrices, viz. Bus Injection to Branch Current and Branch-Current to Bus-Voltage matrices, to find out the solution, modeling of transformer and other components of distribution systems, load flow solution of unbalanced radical distribution networks.\n\nImproved load flow method for unbalanced Radical Distribution System using sequence components. The different connections of transformer in as unbalanced radial distribution networks. Three phase load flow method by solving algebraic recursive expression of voltage significance.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Load Flow Solution of Unbalanced Radial Distribution Networks</h2>\nEfficient method for load flow analysis plays an important role in automation algorithms of Radical Distribution System whose scope encloses fault isolation, network reconfiguration and service restoration. Automation algorithm is capable of handling these complex tasks that need frequent topological variations in the Radical Distribution System which demands a dynamic topology processor based on a well-defined data structure.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Unbalanced Radial Distribution System</h3>\nUnbalanced radial distribution system can be modeled as a network of buses connected by distribution lines, switches or transformers. Each bus may have a corresponding load, shunt capacitor and co-generator connected to it. This model represented by a radial interconnection of copies of the usual building block for the analysis of power transmission line, two fundamental assumptions made, namely:\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Three-phase Currents Balanced</h3>\nTransposition of the conductors to get balanced line parameters. However, distribution systems do not give themselves to either of the two assumptions. Due to dominance of single-phase loads, the assumptions of balanced three-phase currents are not applicable.\n\nDistribution lines are hardly changed, nor can it be assumed that the conductor configuration is an equilateral triangle. When two assumptions are invalid, it is necessary to introduce another proper method of calculating the line obstruction.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Lumped Load</h3>\nIn distribution systems loads exist in one, two and three phase loads with delta connections. Also loads can differentiated into four types depending on the load characteristics like constant power, constant impedance, constant current and complex loads. In this chapter, the loads considered as constant power type and can mathematically represented as follows\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Distributed Load</h3>\nAt times the primary feeder supplies loads through distribution transformers tapped at various locations along line section. If each load point modeled as a bus topology, there will be large number of bus topology in the system. Hence these loads represented as lumped loads:\n<ul>\n \t<li>At one-fourth length of line from sending a dummy bus created at which two third of the load assumed to connect.</li>\n \t<li>The remaining one-third load assumed to connect at the receiving end bus.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Transformer</h3>\nThe impact of the transformers in a distribution system is significant. Transformers affect system loss, &lt;span\"&gt;zero sequence current, method of grounding and protection strategy.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Core Loss</h3>\nThe core loss of a transformer approximated by shunt core loss functions on each phase of the secondary terminal of the transformer. These core loss approximation functions based on the results of load modeling analysis which analyze that real and reactive power loss in the transformer core can express as functions of the terminal voltage of the transformer. Transformer core loss functions represented in per unit at the system power base.",

        "content": "Load Flow Analysis or Power Flow Analysis is the most crucial tactic to exploring problems in power system operating and planning. Based on a specified generating state and transmission network structure, load flow analysis solves the steady operation state with node voltages and branch power flow in the power system. Load flow provides sinusoidal steady state of complete system - real and reactive power generated, voltages and absorbed and line losses. Since the load is a static quantity and it is the power that flows through transmission lines it is also known as Power Flow studies.\n<h2>Why Load Flow Analysis is Important?</h2>\nPerforming a power flow study helps you plan ahead and account for various hypothetical situations. For example, if a transmission line is to be taken off line for maintenance, can the remaining lines in the system handle the required loads without exceeding their rated values.\n\n<strong>Power flow studies are undertaken for various reasons, some of which are the following:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The line flows</li>\n \t<li>The bus voltages and system voltage profile</li>\n \t<li>The effect of change in configuration and incorporating new circuits on system loading</li>\n \t<li>The effect of temporary loss of transmission capacity and (or) generation on system loading and accompanied effects.</li>\n \t<li>The effect of in-phase and quadrative boost voltages on system loading</li>\n \t<li>Economic system operation</li>\n \t<li>System loss minimization</li>\n \t<li>Transformer tap setting for economic operation</li>\n \t<li>Possible improvements to an existing system by change of conductor sizes and system voltages</li>\n</ul>\nThrough the load flow studies we can attain the voltage levels and angles at every bus in steady state. This is rather important as the magnitudes of the bus voltages are required to be held within a specified limit. Once the bus voltage angles and levels are calculated using the load flow, reactive and real power drift through every line can be calculated. Also based on the difference between power flow in the sending and receiving ends, the losses in a particular line can also be computed. Moreover, from the line flow we can also find out the over and under load states. Power flow or load flow solution is essential for continuous evaluation of the performance of the power systems so that suitable control measures can be taken in case of necessity.\n<h2>What is done During Load Flow Analysis?</h2>\nA load flow study is the analysis of an electrical network carried out by an electrical engineer.  The purpose is to understand how power flows around the electrical network.  Implementation of a load flow study helps the engineer in designing electrical systems which functions correctly, have enough power supplied by the power grid, where gear is properly sized, reactive power compensation is properly placed and transformer taps are optimised.\n\nUnderstanding how power flows is crucial to the design of any system.  For simple radial systems, often no formal load flow study is performed, but unchangeably it is part of any analysis performed during the design of the system.   For larger power distribution systems, a formal load flow study is carried out; typically using software, with the results presented in a report.\n\nWhile performing a load flow study, it is important to mathematically describe the electrical network and perform calculations to get the necessary results.\n\n<strong>The study of load flow involves the following three steps:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Modelling of power system components and network.</li>\n \t<li>Development of load flow equations.</li>\n \t<li>Solving the load flow equations using numerical techniques.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How is Load Flow Study Performed?</h2>\n<h3>Mathematical Analysis</h3>\n<strong>There are number of steps to be done while mathematically analysing load flow. They are:</strong>\n\n<strong>Step 1:</strong> Represent the system by its one line diagram.\n\n<strong>Step 2:</strong> Convert all quantities to Per Unit. We need to find all the parameters that we are given with respect to one common base value. This base value is normally clearly mentioned, but if not we can presume one and move on.\n\n<strong>Step 3:</strong> Draw the Impedance Diagram.\n\n<strong>Step 4:</strong> Obtain the Ybus matrix.\n\n<strong>Step 5:</strong> Classify the buses\n\n<strong>Step 6:</strong> Start answering the missing variables, by assumptions (unless it is specified otherwise).\n\n<strong>Step 7:</strong> Find approximations for the Real and Reactive Power that we are given, using the assumed and given values for voltage/angles/admittance.\n\n<strong>Step 8: </strong>Write the Jacobian Matrix for the first iteration of the Newton Raphson Method.\n\n<strong>Step 9:</strong> Solve for the unknown differences, using Cramers Rule.\n\n<strong>Step 10:</strong> We now need to repeat step 7 – 9 iteratively until we obtain an accurate value for the unknown differences as the [Symbol]0. Normally we only do 2 iterations. And other indefinite parameters are calculated.\n<h3>Software Analysis</h3>\nSoftware is utilised in most of the realistic or real-time conditions since they are easier.  In doing this, the electrical engineer builds a network of nodes interconnected by admittances (impedances).\n\n<strong>Each system node has four key parameters:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Active power (P)</li>\n \t<li>Reactive power (Q )</li>\n \t<li>Voltage magnitude (V)</li>\n \t<li>Voltage phase angle (δ)</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>In defining nodes in a software model, the engineer typically considers three types:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Load Bus [P-Q bus], a bus where the real and reactive power are specified.</li>\n \t<li>Generator Bus [P-V bus], a bus in which the voltage and real power generation is known.</li>\n \t<li>Slack Bus (Swing bus), where the voltage magnitude and phase are assumed known.</li>\n</ul>\nIn a study most, nodes are of the load bus type.  The generator bus type is all the nodes that have a generator connected.  While more than one slack bus could be defined, it is usual to have only one, and this is chosen as the connection point to the main grid supply.\n\nThe engineer will construct the network mock-up by setting busbars, grid connections, interconnections, generators and major items of equipment. The software will then carry out the necessary calculations.\n\nUsing software simplifies the carrying out of a load flow study.  However, the selection of input data required, level of detail to model, verification and interpretation of the output and utilising this to achieve the required design still requires the input of a skilled electrical engineer.\n\n<em><strong>Carelabs is authorized provider of Electrical Installation's Study, Analysis, Inspection, and Certification services in UAE, and offer load flow study and analysis services.</strong></em>",

        "content": "<em><strong>Carelabs is authorized provider of Electrical Installation's Study, Analysis, Inspection, and Certification services in UAE, and offer short circuit study and analysis services.</strong></em>\n<h2><strong>Short Circuit</strong></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A short circuit is the flow of electricity in an unintended path of lower resistance or diversion of electricity. Short circuits result from unintended connections to ground, two points of different voltages coming into contact, or two phases contacting each other. In many cases the flow of electricity is through near-zero resistance connection, resulting in very high electricity levels.</span>\n<h2><strong>When Short Circuit Dangerous?</strong></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A short circuit current can very large. This can result in large, rapid releases of energy in the form of heat, intense magnetic fields, and even potentially as explosions known as an arc blast. The heat can damage or destroy wiring insulation and electrical components. An arc blast produces a shock wave that may carry vaporized or molten metal, and can  fatal to unprotected people who are close by.</span>\n<h2><strong>Bolted, Arcing and Ground Faults</strong></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A connected failure usually results from a manufacturing or assembly error that results in two conductors of different voltages being \"bolted\" together, or source of power directly connected to ground. Since the connectors are solidly bolted there in no arc created and the high current quickly trips a protective device limiting the damage.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An arc fault is in which short circuit creates an arc. An arc is a flow of electricity between two conductors that are not in contact. The resulting intense heat can result in a fire, significant damage to the equipment, and possibly an arc flash or arc blast resulting in serious injuries.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A ground fault is in which electricity finds an unintended, low resistance path to ground. When that path goes through a human body the resulting heat can cause serious burns, and the electrical shock can disrupt the functioning of the human heart (fibrillation).</span>\n<h2><strong>Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Currents</strong></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A polyphase system may experience either a symmetrical or an asymmetrical failure. Symmetrical failure electricity affects all phases equally. If some of the phases affected unequally, then the fault current is asymmetrical.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Symmetrical faults are comparatively simple to analyse</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, however they account for very few failures. Only about 5% of faults are symmetrical. Asymmetrical faults are more difficult to analyse, but they are the more common type of fault.</span>\n<h2><strong>Protective Devices for Short Circuit Analysis</strong></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Protective devices designed to detect a fault condition and shut off the electricity before significant damage. There are a number of different types of protective devices, the two most common are:</span>\n<h3><b>Fuses and Circuit Breakers</b></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fuses and circuit breakers used to protect an electrical circuit from an over-current situation, usually resulting from short circuit, by cutting off the power supply. Fuses can only be used once. Circuit breakers may reset and used multiple times.</span>\n<h3><b>Ground Fault Interrupter (GFI)</b></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This device detects when the electricity flow in the energized conductor are not equal to return electricity in the neutral conductor. The Ground Fault Interrupter</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">protects people by quickly cutting off the electric flow preventing injuries resulting from shock.  Ground Fault hecklers are typically used in homes for bathroom, kitchen, and outdoor electrical sockets. The Ground Fault Interrupter</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will typically be built into the electrical socket.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Ground Fault Interrupter</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does not give over-current protection, and the circuit that includes a Ground Fault Interrupter</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will include a fuse or circuit breaker.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As well as fuses, circuit breakers, and GFIs, there are electrical protection devices that:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Detect changes in current or voltage levels</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guide the ratio of voltage to current</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give over-voltage protection</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give under-voltage protection</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Detect reverse-current flow</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Detect phase reversal</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Benefits of Short Circuit Analysis</strong></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conducting a short circuit analysis has the following benefits:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helps avoid unplanned outages and downtime.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is critical for avoiding interruptions of essential services</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reduces the risk of equipment damage and fires</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increases safety and protects people from injuries</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Determines the level and type of protective devices that needed.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Provides the information needed for NEC and NFPA required labels</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keeps you compliance NEC requirements</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Short Circuit Current Calculation</strong></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NEC 110 requires that a short circuit analysis done for all electrical equipment and panels. The most accepted standards for short circuit analysis are the ANSI/IEEE C37.010-1979 standard and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 60909 standard.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ANSI C37.010 standard intended to use for power circuit breaker choice, but it does give information needed for NEC 110 required labelling. The IEC 60909-3:2009 standard is more generic. It proposed to give general guidance for short-circuit analysis of any asymmetrical short circuit in three-phase 50 Hz or 60Hz A.C. electrical system.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Either the ANSI or the IEC short circuit calculation method can use. They compared and found to produce similar results. The ANSI method is generally used in short circuit analysis software. Sometimes it may feel that the IEC method lends itself to manual calculations.</span>",

        "description": "Harmonic study and analysis is recommended to predict harmonic levels and identify potential resonance problems regardless of the rectifier pulse number.",
        "content": "Harmonics are electric voltages and currents on an electric power system that can cause power quality problems. Because equipment and machinery can malfunction or fail in the presence of high harmonic voltage and/or current levels, harmonic distortion has become a growing concern for facility managers, users of automation equipment, and engineers.\n\n<strong>Harmonics can cause:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Circulating currents and high voltages caused by harmonic resonance</li>\n \t<li>Equipment malfunctions due to excessive voltage distortion</li>\n \t<li>Increased internal energy losses in connected equipment, causing component failure and shortened life span</li>\n \t<li>False tripping of branch circuit breakers</li>\n \t<li>Metering errors</li>\n \t<li>Fires in wiring and distribution systems</li>\n \t<li>Generator failures</li>\n \t<li>Lower system power factor</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why is Harmonic study and Analysis Necessary?</h2>\nAlthough the possibility of harmonic problems is narrow, the cases in which they do appear can lead to reduction in power system reliability. Harmonics degrade the level of power quality and its efficiency, particularly in a commercial building or industrial facility. An insight of the potential effects and causes can help avoid harmonic related problems at the design stage and decrease the possibility of undesired effects happening on start-up.\n\nIEEE Std. 519-1992, which is titled \"IEEE Recommended Practices and Requirements for Harmonic Control in Electric Power Systems\", Chapter 10 \"Recommended Practices for Individual Consumers\", this section is written from the perspective that harmonics must be within acceptable limits at the point where the power system serves more than one customer.\n\nIt should be kept in mind that only when the non-linear loads become a substantial portion of the total load, harmonic study and analysis is recommended to predict harmonic levels and identify potential resonance problems regardless of the rectifier pulse number. Most buildings can withstand nonlinear loads of up to 16% of the total electrical system capacity without concern. If the nonlinear loads exceed 16%, some non-apparent negative consequences can result.\n<h3>In the following cases harmonic study need to be performed:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>If in the design state of a project, if the measure of the nonlinear loads surpasses 25% of the total loads on a bus or a system, a harmonic analysis study is necessary to verify the agreement with the predetermined harmonic limits.</li>\n \t<li>To solve harmonic-related problems such as failure of electrical equipment or malfunction of protective relays.</li>\n \t<li>If present plant is expanding and a major amount of nonlinear loads is going to be inserted, then a harmonic analysis study is necessary to check the plant functioning after the addition of these loads.</li>\n \t<li>If a capacitor bank is added in any electrical system that comprise numerous nonlinear loads, then a harmonic analysis is necessary to verify the probability of resonance occurrence.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is Done During Harmonic Study and Analysis?</h2>\nHarmonic analysis or harmonic modelling is an arithmetical method of foreseeing potential resonances and harmonic distortion levels depending on the available power system data. All but the simplest of systems will require a computer to perform this analysis. A number of software packages are available specifically for this purpose.\n\nEquipment like transformers, capacitors and utility system impedance are considered and non-linear loads are represented by several frequency harmonic current sources. Such a modelling study will indicate if harmonic levels will fall within IEEE or utility limits.\n<h3>Two types of analysis are present in a harmonic analysis and study:</h3>\n<strong>Current and Voltage Distortion Analysis\n</strong>The discrete and whole current and voltage harmonic distortions are estimated at several buses then the outcome are judged against the predetermined limits.\n\n<strong>Impedance versus Frequency Analysis\n</strong>A chart of the system impedance at different buses is plotted against the frequency. This analysis is important in predicting the system resonances prior to energizing the electrical system. A rise in the impedance plot implies a parallel resonance while a depression in the impedance plot denotes a series resonance.\n\nIf harmonic analysis denotes extreme harmonic levels or a potentially harmful resonance condition, there are numerous substitute corrective actions that can be performed.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Implement a rectifier with a pulse number higher than 6.</li>\n \t<li>Relocate or disconnect a small amount of power factor correction capacitance to shift a resonant frequency away from a characteristic harmonic.</li>\n \t<li>Harmonic filters can also be added to the system.</li>\n \t<li>Implementing a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) rectifier.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How is Harmonic Study and Analysis Performed?</h2>\nA harmonics analyser is the best equipment for conducting study and analysis of power quality to find out the wave shapes of current and voltage on corresponding frequency spectrums. A harmonic analyser is also useful in instances where the lack of obvious symptoms prevent you from determining if harmonics are a cause for concern. A harmonics analyser is used to provide a detailed analysis of the suspect source.\n\n<strong>Similar to other power systems studies the harmonics study consists of the following steps:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Definition of harmonic-producing equipment and determination of models for their representation.</li>\n \t<li>Determination of the models to represent other components in the system including external networks.</li>\n \t<li>Simulation of the system for various scenarios.</li>\n</ul>\nIf a harmonic analysis study is required to be performed, the following steps should be followed:\n\n<strong>Step 1:</strong> Obtain the electrical system one-line diagram and highlight the available nonlinear loads, capacitor banks and medium voltage cables of long length within the industrial system.\n\n<strong>Step 2:</strong> Focus the place of common coupling (PCC) which is the point that joins the industrial network with the facility or with the adjacent plant.\n\n<strong>Step 3:</strong> Highlight the in-plant system buses that are expected to be affected from harmonic distortions.\n\n<strong>Step 4:</strong> Gather the harmonics-related data of all nonlinear loads within the plant.\n\n<strong>Step 5:</strong> From the utility company, get the important data of voltage and current harmonics at the predetermined PCC including the highest and lowest short circuit fault levels and the permitted limits on current and voltage harmonics because the permitted harmonic limits differ from country to country.\n\n<strong>Step 6:</strong> Mock-up the electrical network with the help of any of the accessible software like electrical transient analyser program (ETAP).\n\n<strong>Step 7:</strong> Perform the harmonic analysis for the electrical network at the various possible operating scenarios.\n\n<strong>Step 8:</strong> Verify whole and discrete levels of current and voltage distortion levels at the concerned system buses and at the PCC.\n\n<strong>Step 9:</strong> Check the harmonic frequency spectrum, which is a plot of each individual harmonic value with respect to the fundamental value versus frequency.\n\n<strong>Step 10:</strong> If the harmonic distortion outcome surpasses the permitted levels, chose a suitable harmonic mitigation solution and the best insertion point for that solution.\n\n<strong>Step 11:</strong> Re-perform the harmonic analysis study after adding the harmonic mitigation technique to ensure compliance with the contractual / international harmonic limits.\n\n<em><strong>Carelabs is authorized provider of Electrical Installation's Study, Analysis, Inspection, and Certification services in UAE, and offer harmonic acceleration study and analysis services.</strong></em>",

Our expertise is widely recognized in the industry and our engineers are members of IEEE, NFPA and IEC which set the standards for arc flash studies.\n<h2>The Processes Involved in Arc Flash Hazard Study and Analysis?</h2>\nWorking within NFPA and IEEE guidelines, our experienced power systems engineers will perform accurate systematic Arc Flash Hazard Analysis as follows:\n\n<strong>Short Circuit Calculations</strong>\n\nWe will either use your data or gather the data to make calculations for you to identify bolted and arcing fault levels at key points in a power distribution system.\n\n<strong>Protective Device Coordination</strong>\n\nWe can perform an electrical systems coordination study or use the customer’s study, to determine the duration of the arcing faults.\n\n<strong>Arc Flash Hazard Calculations</strong>\n\nThe incident energy level, the flash hazard boundary, and the PPE required are then calculated for each location.\n\n<strong>Documentation</strong>\n\nThe information above is compiled for you into a comprehensive report, which contains information necessary to comply with regulatory requirements.\n\n<strong>Unsafe Work Locations</strong>\n\nThe report will identify work locations having incident energy level in excess of available PPE ratings.\n\n<strong>Arc Flash Hazard Mitigation</strong>\n\nRecommendations will be made to minimize Arc Flash Hazards by changes in system protection or operational procedures.\n\n<strong>Arc Flash Hazard Labels</strong>\n\nIn addition to the report, our customers will receive a field label containing the flash hazard boundary distance, incident energy level, and PPE category and shock category and shock hazard for each location.\n<h2>How do we Conduct Arc Flash Hazard Study and Analysis?</h2>\n<h3>We perform arc flash hazard study through following steps</h3>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Data Collection</strong>\n\nInitial steps are data collection and determining modes of operation. To perform an arc flash hazard analysis, data is collected about the facility's power distribution system. The data includes the arrangement of components on a one-line drawing with nameplate specifications of every device. Also required are details of the lengths and cross section area of all cables. The utility will be contacted for information including the minimum and maximum fault currents that can be expected at the entrance. The modes of operation are used to study worst case scenarios that may lead to arc flash, such as operations with circuit breakers open or closed or with certain motors or generators running or not running.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Engineering Analysis of the Data</strong>\n\nOnce the data has been collected, a short circuit analysis followed by a coordination study is performed. The resultant data is fed into the equations described by either NFPA 70E-2000 or IEEE Standard 1584-2002. These equations will produce the necessary flash protection boundary distances and incident energy to determine the minimum PPE requirement.\n\nA short circuit study is required to determine the magnitude of current flowing throughout the power system at critical points at various time intervals after a “fault” occurs. These calculations will be used to determine the bolted fault current, which is essential for the calculation of incident energy and interrupting ratings of your equipment. A bolted fault current occurs as a result of two conductors becoming joined together. Comparison of equipment ratings with calculated short circuit and operating conditions will identify underrated equipment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Protective Device Coordination</strong>\n\nOnce flash hazard analysis is performed, most likely it will be discovered that category 4 PPE will be required in most places. Compliance with the new arc flash regulations means that not only does the coordination study need to be more accurate but it also needs to take into account the fact that the arc fault current is less than the bolted fault current. Protective device coordination is performed to ensure selection and arrangement of protective devices limits the effects of an overcurrent situation to the smallest area. Results will be used to make recommendations for mitigation of arc flash hazards. Although this is an optional study, arc flash mitigation cannot be performed without completing this step. We perform this study in accordance with IEEE Std.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Arc Flash Calculations</strong>\n\nIn this step we determine incident energies and flash protection boundaries, respectively, for all equipment. The incident energy is the energy needed for an arc flash to cause second-degree burns. The flash protection boundary is specified as the distance where the incident energy or second-degree burns are caused. These calculations are based on available short circuit current, protective device clearing time and distance from the arc. Calculations of incident energy levels and flash protection boundaries will be completed for all relevant equipment busses.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Arc Flash Study and Analysis Report</strong>\n\nUpon completion of the calculations, we will prepare your Arc Flash Report. This will be provided to you for a short review period, during which your team can evaluate modifications. At this point, we can hold meeting to deduce the report results. Upon approval, we will provide a final report and full sized one-line diagrams, stamped by our Registered Professional Engineer. The drawings and report will also be supplied to you in a digital format.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Label Installation</strong>\n\nWe will create and install arc flash warning labels. These labels pinpoint incident energy and working distance, nominal system voltage, and the arc flash boundary. In addition to standard requirements, our labels also contains Limited, Restricted and Prohibited approach boundaries, date, upstream protective device and recommended personal protection equipment(PPE). We can also provide bolted fault current if desired.\n<h2>Who Needs Arc Flash Hazard Study and Analysis?</h2>\nMost commercial, institutional, and industrial electrical systems have arc flash hazards. OSHA requires that those systems be individually analysed and, if hazards exist, labelled to identify the arc flash boundary. This will increase personnel safety, reduce shock hazards and reduce arc flash injuries. We can provide arc flash studies using the latest software. Tailored results by Carelabs allow you to reduce the cost of the services you need without paying for those you don't need. We specialize in achieving fulfillment without excessive data and reports.",

        "description": "There are two methods by which voltage drop study and analysis can be done: Manual, ETAP",
        "content": "In an electric circuit the existing energy of a voltage supply decreases as electric current travels through the components that does not supply voltage i.e. passive elements of an electrical circuit. This is called Voltage Drop. Each point in a circuit can be assigned a voltage that's proportional to its electrical elevation, so to speak. Voltage drop is simply the arithmetical difference between a higher voltage and a lower one. The National Electrical Code states that a voltage drop of 5% at the furthest receptacle in a branch wiring circuit is acceptable for normal efficiency\n<h2>Why Perform Voltage Drop Study and Analysis?</h2>\n<h3>Following are the harm caused by extensive voltage drop:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Low voltage to the equipment being powered, causing improper, erratic, or no operation - and damage to the equipment.</li>\n \t<li>Poor efficiency and wasted energy.</li>\n \t<li>Heating at a high resistance connection/splice may result in a fire at high ampere loads.</li>\n</ul>\nOne cannot determine exactly at what point voltage drop can cause fire, because it varies with the amount of current flowing through the high resistance connection, the resistance of that connection etc. Number of factors must be considered regarding at what point ignition will occur, example:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Is the high resistance connection in connection with a flammable matter?</li>\n \t<li>Is there air flow to dissipate the heat?</li>\n \t<li>Is the area around the connection insulated, so that heat cannot escape?</li>\n</ul>\nVoltage drop study and analysis must be taken into consideration so that it may hardly affect the instruments. Like some household appliances that have a fixed capacity power engines are strongly influenced by voltage drop.\n\n<strong>The main ways to reduce voltage drop are to:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Increase power factor (add capacitors)</li>\n \t<li>Replace the conductor with a larger size.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is Done During Voltage Drop Study and Analysis?</h2>\nThe reduction of any rate in the voltage leads to a rise in the current at the same rate and the problem is that this increase is often not huge. If we assume that this increase in the current was by 11%, it means that circuit breaker will not feel this increase and it will not operate while the device suffers from this increase in the current and thus leading to the increase in temperature gradually with time until it reaches the stage of the combustion. Another example the voltage drop by 1% lead to decrease in illuminance of tungsten lamp by 3%.\n\nThe amount of power delivered to a component in a circuit is equal to the voltage drop across that component's terminals multiplied by the current flow through the component:\n\nP = V*I\n\nV = voltage drop in volts\n\nI = current flow in amperes and\n\nP =power in watts.\n\nObviously, if either V or I is zero, no power or energy is delivered to that component, so it can't fulfil any useful purpose. So voltage drop is a vital feature of all electric circuits and is planned and controlled very carefully by the engineers that design those circuits.\n\nSo the transformers and the distribution boxes must be situated in a position such that maximum voltage drop from transformer to the furthest point doesn't exceed 5% of the nominal voltage. lf it hard to find a place for the transformer so that maximum voltage drop is less than 5%, then we must use cables with larger cross-section area but It will increase the cost.\n<h2>How is Voltage Drop Study and Analysis Done?</h2>\n<strong>There are two methods by which voltage drop study and analysis can be done:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Manual</li>\n \t<li>ETAP</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Manual Voltage Drop Study and Analysis</h2>\n<h3>Ohm’s Law Method – Single-Phase Only</h3>\nVoltage drop of the circuit conductors is calculated by multiplying the complete resistance of the circuit conductors by the current through the circuit:\n\nVD = I x R\n\nI = Load in amperes\n\nR = Resistance of the conductor\n\nThis method cannot be used for 3 phase circuits.\n<h3>Voltage Drop Using the Formula Method</h3>\nThe voltage drop of circuit with already installed conductors can be calculated by:\n\nVD = 2 * K * Q * I * D/CM - Single Phase\n\nVD = 1.732 * K * Q * I * D/CM - Three Phase\n\nVD = Volts Dropped\n\nK = Direct Current Constant\n\nQ = Alternating Current Adjustment Factor’\n\nI = Amperes\n\nD = Distance\n\nCM = Circular-Mils\n<h2>Electrical Transient Analyzer Programming (ETAP):</h2>\nSince 1970s, ETAP has been a significant designing podium utilised for designing, analysing, and optimising electrical power systems. ETAP is a completely assimilated Electrical software solutions comprising of load flow, arc flash, short circuit and more. Its flexible performance makes it apt for all companies in any shape or form.\n\nOperation Technology, Inc. is the developer of ETAP, the most wide-ranging analysis software for the simulation, design, operation, control, monitoring and automation of power systems. ETAP is the industry leader used worldwide in all types and sizes of power systems such as manufacturing, oil and gas, steel, mining, cement, and more.\n\n<strong>We can approximate the voltage drop along a circuit as:</strong>\n\nVdrop= |Vs| – |Vr| ≈ IR·R + IX·X\n\nWhere, Vdrop= voltage drop along the feeder\n\nR= line resistance\n\nX= line reactance\n\nIR= line current due to real power flow (in phase with the voltage)\n\nIX= line current due to reactive power flow (90°out of phase with the voltage)\n\nThe biggest fault happens under leading power factor and heavy current. The approximation has an error less than 1% for an angle between the sending and receiving end voltages.\n\n<strong>This estimation brings two crucial factors about voltage drop into the light:</strong>\n\nResistive load: At large power factors, the voltage drop is related directly to the resistance of the conductors. The resistance plays a crucial role, even though the resistance is generally less than the reactance.\n\nReactive load: At medium or small power factors, the voltage drop relates mostly to the reactance of the conductors. Because the reactance is usually larger than the resistance, the reactive load causes most of the voltage drop. Poor power factor significantly increases voltage drop.\n\n<em><strong>Carelabs is authorized provider of Electrical Installation’s Study, Analysis, Inspection, and Certification services in UAE, and offer voltage drop study and analysis services.</strong></em>",

        "content": "The necessity for ground resistance levels are becoming stricter these days because of the smaller operating voltages and bigger operating speeds in today’s electronics. As the experts in electrical grounding solutions, we use specialized design software to model and build an electrical grounding system design based on the soil data, design goals, and other factors. After modelling the area, we will engineer an electrical grounding system design that will meet your performance objectives.\n<h2>Why is Grounding System Study and Analysis Done?</h2>\nThe aim of grounding system analysis is to design grounding systems such that, in case of high fault currents, the acceptable levels of step and touch potentials are hedged below their maximum permissible levels and to investigate techniques, which are capable of reducing grounding resistances to the acceptable value.\n\nGrounding keeps devices safe from surges, lightning, and faults. Few gears also need grounding as a vital component for operation, as it aids as a reference point for different measures.\n\nThe grounding system studies will detect any installation or calibration errors in your grounding system. These include things such as problems in tripping tolerance, polarity issues and neutral connections to ground. A grounding system analysis will determine if your equipment has proper ground fault protection installed and operating.\n<h2>What is Done During Grounding System Analysis?</h2>\nThe value of body resistance is dependent on the many unpredictable factors that follow:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Skin condition</li>\n \t<li>Touch voltage (nonlinearity)</li>\n \t<li>Touch condition</li>\n \t<li>Magnitude and duration of shock current</li>\n</ul>\nAccording to IEEE Std80-2000, the value of body resistance is usually selected as 1000Ω. Once the body resistance (Rb) and the foot resistance (Rf) are determined, both the touch and step voltage can be calculated for Rft. For the touch-voltage-equivalent circuit, the foot resistance is the parallel resistance of two feet and its value is\n\n<strong>Rft=Rf/2</strong>\n\nFor the step-voltage-equivalent circuit, the foot resistance is the series resistance of two feet and its value is\n\n<strong>Rft=2Rf</strong>\n<h3>Two major factors that should be achieved from ground system analysis are:</h3>\n<strong>Soil Resistivity\n</strong>Soil resistivity testing is critical for high performance electrical grounding system design. Accurate soil resistivity data enables precise designs and predictable results. The kind of dampness, soil and temperature also influences soil resistance.\n\n<strong>Human Safety\n</strong>Human safety is critical during ground potential rise events in work place areas. Electrical grounding safety systems are required to protect personnel working where ground rise potential hazards are known to exist. In fact, federal law mandates that all known hazards must be eliminated from the work place for the safety of workers\n<h2>How is Ground System Study and Analysis Done?</h2>\n<strong>Step 1: Grounding system safety assessment\n</strong>The electric body current provides the basis for safety assessment of grounding systems. Based on available experimental data, the IEEE Std80-2000 [1] suggests that electric body currents below Ib can be tolerated by average person. Thus according to this standard, the maximum allowable body current is:\n\n<strong>Ib= 0.116/√tf amps</strong>\n\nWhere tf is duration of electric current in seconds.\n\nIn order to satisfy with the safety requirements of grounding systems, the maximum touch and step potential should not exceed the allowable values calculated with available equations. Thus, when it is necessary to optimize total cost of grounding systems, the computed values of touch and step potential of each desired grounding grid need to be constrained under the allowable values. Otherwise, the unqualified design of grounding systems should be abandoned.\n\n<strong>Step 2: Electromagnetic analysis and green’s functions\n</strong>The key point for analysing and optimizing grounding systems is knowing how to calculate the grounding systems safety metrics (touch potential, step potential etc.) of each specific grounding grid. Once the safety metrics are obtained, it is easy to compare them with allowable values.\n\nIn order to calculate the grounding system parameters more accurately, it is necessary to break the underground conductors and rods into small horizontal and vertical segments. The segments may be located in either the upper or lower conducting regions. In addition, it is assumed that the fault current injected into the earth is the direct current without any calculations of inductance or capacitance and the voltage drop from one point of a grounding grid to any other point of same grid is negligible for simplicity of the model.\n\n<strong>Step 3: Complex image method\n</strong>In order to improve the efficiency of Green’s functions calculation, the complex images method has been developed to calculate the grounding systems parameters. The most significant improvement of complex images method is the implementation of finite series in place of the infinite Taylor series. The high accuracy and efficiency of the complex image method is because of the introduction of the imaginary part from image magnitude. In other words, the imaginary part brings some extra degrees of freedom\n\n<strong>Step 4: Voltage Produced by Horizontal Lines of Current\n</strong>In this, the Green's Function solutions (point current source solutions) are used to determine of the voltages produced in the three regions due to a horizontal one-dimensional-(line) source of current located in the upper-layer or the lower-layer. The superposition theorem is employed to find the voltage in the three regions as a summation of the voltages due to a distribution of point currents, which are located on a horizontal line somewhere in the soil model.\n\n<strong>Step 5: Calculation of mutual and self-resistance\n</strong>The equations for calculating the ground grid resistance to remote earth and touch/step potential are developed in terms of mutual and self-resistance of conductors. If the conductor whose induced voltage to be calculated is at a different location from the source, the potential on this conductor would vary along its length.\n\n<strong>Step 6: Results compared with WINIGS\n</strong>The results obtained from before are compared with WINIGS. Comparison between surface potential and self-resistance, between WINIGS and OPTIMGRID (An application developed based on the available equations) is performed.\n\nThe National Electric Code states that the resistance to ground shall not exceed 25 ohms for a single electrode. However, great technology manufacturers will often state 3 or 5 ohms, depending upon the requirements of their equipment. For delicate gear and under intense conditions, a 1 ohm reading might sometimes become necessary. When scheming a ground system, the chance of a hazard and expense grow exponentially as the target resistance to ground becomes closer to the unachievable aim of zero ohms.\n\n<em><strong>Carelabs is authorized provider of Electrical Installation's Study, Analysis, Inspection, and Certification services in UAE, and offer grounding system design and planning services.</strong></em>",

        "content": "Motor Starting Study and Analysis recognises the probable voltage dip and acceleration time for a motor and the consequences of motor starting on a system. It assesses proper starting and running of motors on load with given system inertia without causing tripping or instability in the system. Other starting methods, such as autotransformer start, reactor, across-the-line, capacitor, or are also studied. If system voltage dips are a concern, Carelabs will propose the appropriate solutions.\n\nThe starting current of most AC motors is several times the normal full rated load current when starting from full line voltage. These large current requirements can result in nuisance tripping of protection breakers, excessive running currents, drop in terminal voltage etc. Dimming of lights as motors start up is a clear indicator that the power system may need investigation. It may have insufficient capacity or a better motor starting strategy may be required.\n<h2>Why is Motor Starting Study and Analysis Done?</h2>\nThe starting torque varies directly as the square of the applied voltage. Thus excessive starting current results in drop in terminal voltage and may result in the following:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Failure of motor starting due to low starting torques.</li>\n \t<li>Unnecessary operation of under voltage relays.</li>\n \t<li>Stalling of other running motors connected to the network.</li>\n \t<li>Voltage dips at the power sources and consequent flicker in the lighting system.</li>\n</ul>\nThe most serious effect of a large voltage drop or brown out is an increase in current of all devices servicing a constant load. Static power supplies such as computers and ballasts for lighting must increase the current to deliver the same amount of power resulting in overheating and eventually burn-out. Other induction motors operating at sync speed will increase their current draw until it reaches maximum current and may slip out of sync further increasing the current demand.\n\nMotor starting studies assists in the choice of the proper motor design, the best method of starting and the proper system design for reducing the effect of the motor starting. Motor starting studies are essential in determining the impact on system voltage during starting and in establishing whether the motor will start satisfactorily and come up to speed. The result of these studies allows engineers\n<ul>\n \t<li>To start motors individually</li>\n \t<li>Use load transitioning to test the impact of fast bus transfer voltage</li>\n \t<li>Enable load-group actions.</li>\n</ul>\nIn various electrical installations in industrial and commercial units, engineers are continuously verifying and stimulating motor starting and acceleration systems to determine whether they are working properly. The essential areas they must evaluate are the starting, stopping and restarting of electrical motors.\n<h2>What is Done During Motor Starting Study and Analysis?</h2>\nMotor starting studies vary from instantaneous start-up of one or more of the largest motors to detailed simulation of the current, voltage and speed with respect to time. This allows engineers to test different slow start mechanisms ranging from auto-transformers to variable frequency drives and determine the optimum settings for start-up time and effect on the system. If a starting device is needed, its characteristics and ratings can be easily determined.\n\nStudy of motor starting methods can be done using both static and dynamic simulation methods. These techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages. We believe mainly in transient or dynamic motor starting studies that reproduce measured motor starting conditions.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Load flow type solution with the observed starting impedance of the motor modelled as part of network modelling.</li>\n \t<li>Short circuit method type of calculations considering pre-fault short circuit conditions and using voltage drop calculations considering motor starting currents. Alternatively</li>\n \t<li>Where precise dynamic model of the motor electric circuit and load – torque characteristics are existing, dynamic model of the motor can be utilised in traditional transient stability algorithm to evaluate the impact of the motor starting.</li>\n \t<li>When there is a lack of precise model information, transient stability studies can be utilised, where the measured starting current can be applied as a nodal injection at the motor bus as a dynamic event and the system response to this dynamic event can be measured.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How is Motor Starting Study and Analysis Performed?</h2>\nThe output torque is related to square of the voltage. If an AC induction or synchronous motor is started while attached to a mechanical load on the shaft, inrush current can be up to 6 times full-load current and will be drawn for a longer time. The power system while offering normal service to the remainder of the industrial or commercial system, must also be capable to source enough inrush current to any motor\n\nAs electrical consultants, motor starting studies help to improve the reliability engineering for the entire building system and industrial complex. We help to determine the best way to start large motors in a group help keep large investments of yours running and lasting longer.\n\nThere are various ways to start a motor including:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Direct supply voltage</li>\n \t<li>Direct supply voltage with compensation</li>\n \t<li>Auto-transformers</li>\n \t<li>Soft starters</li>\n \t<li>Star-Delta Starters</li>\n \t<li>Variable Frequency Drives (VFD)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Steps in motor starting analysis:</h3>\n<strong>Step 1:</strong> Motor starting analysis starts at the client site to gather current and historical information.\n\n<strong>Step 2:</strong> Then simulations are run using these measured data and information from the manufacturer.\n\n<strong>Step 3:</strong> From our computer models, we will be able to predict the operation for new installations and to diagnosis problems and offer solutions for existing motor installations.\n\n<strong>Step 4:</strong> We utilise both static and dynamic techniques to create the starting sequence of motors and normally depend on dynamic analysis to recreate observed and measured starting conditions.\n<h3>Following are various types of motor starting study:</h3>\n<strong>The Voltage Drop Snapshot\n</strong>This method examines the effect of voltage dip during motor-starting is to ensure the maximum instantaneous drop that occurs leaves bus voltages at acceptable levels throughout the system. This is done by inspecting the power system that tallies to the worst-case voltage. Through appropriate system modelling, this study can be performed by various calculating methods using the digital computer. Voltage drop snapshot study is beneficial only for measuring system voltages.\n\n<strong>The Detailed Voltage Profile\n</strong>This study allows a more exact examination of the voltage drop situation. Regulator response, exciter operation, and sometimes governor action are modelled to accurately represent transient behaviour of local generators. This type of study is similar to a simplified transient stability analysis and can be considered a series of voltage snapshots throughout the motor-starting interval including the moment of minimum or worst-case voltage.\n\n<strong>The Speed-Torque and Acceleration Time Analysis\n</strong>It is the most precise analysis for motor-starting conditions. Like transient stability study, speed-torque study gives electrical and accelerating torque calculations for definite time intervals during the motor starting period.\n\nIn some conditions, the motor may not be able to break away from standstill. A speed-torque study, mainly when done using a computer program, can foretell these problematic areas and allow corrections to be made before difficulties arise. Speed-torque analysis can help in autotransformer magnetizing current, when exclusive starting techniques are needed, like autotransformer start, reduced voltage starting etc., and it can determine the peak time to switch the transformer out of the circuit. The initial performance of wound rotor motors is inspected using this analysis.\n\nCarelabs uses latest software to calculate speed, slip, electrical output torque, load current, and terminal voltage data at discrete time intervals from locked rotor to full load speed. Also, voltage at important locations throughout the system during start-up will be monitored. The study can help select the best method of starting, the right motor design, or the required system design for minimizing the impact of motor starting on the entire system.\n\n<em><strong>Carelabs is authorized provider of electrical Installation’s Study, Analysis, Inspection, and Certification services in UAE, and offer motor acceleration study and analysis services.</strong></em>",

This type of equipment is directly linked to the reliability of the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">electricity</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> supply</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the basic functions of switchgear is protection, which is interruption of short-circuit and overload fault currents while maintaining service to unaffected circuits. Switchgear also provides isolation of circuits from power supplies. Switchgear is also used to enhance system availability by allowing more than one source to feed a load.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Switchgear can be classified on the basis of voltage level in to the following</span>\n<ol>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Low voltage (LV) Switchgear</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medium voltage (MV) Switchgear</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High voltage (HV) Switchgear</span></li>\n</ol>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Risk assessment is the determination of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">quantitative</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">qualitative</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> estimate of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">risk</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> related to a well-defined situation and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hazard</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you use switchgear you must assess the risks and manage them to ensure safe operation and minimise the risk of injury. A risk assessment is about identifying and taking sensible and proportionate measures to control the risks in your workplace</span>\n<h2><strong>Principles of Risk Assessment</strong></h2>\n<strong>Safety-related risk assessment includes a series of steps</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Detecting the Limits and scope of use of the switchgear assembly; - design and type of switchgear and rated values - ambient conditions - Intended work procedures, besides the regular switching operations, e.g. maintenance, cable testing, work on LV control equipment</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next step entails the examination of the associated hazards, for example those due to - electric shock - arc faults - electromagnetic fields - stored charges (electrical / mechanical) – mechanical hazards. The examination of hazards must also take into account the history of service experience, i.e. knowledge about possible minor and major failures on the equipment</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The subsequent risk estimation considers the severity of harms and their probability of occurrence; such as the - level and extend of damage caused e.g. by arc faults - switching rate and probability of a failure on switching operation.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally an evaluation is carried out to determine whether a tolerable risk has been achieved or a risk reduction through further measures is required. This can be done by using a risk graph. It is dependent on the specific industry, which risk class is tolerated in this area.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Risk reduction implies priorities. Whenever possible the design itself should be inherently safe, supplemented by protective devices and information for the user.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Electrical Switchgear Hazard Categories</strong></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hazards are divided into several main categories, where each category is further subdivided describing specific sources of hazards. The complete list facilitates a thorough check whether all aspects of safety are covered. </span>\n\n<strong>The main categories are: </strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HC 1 Essential health and safety requirements </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HC 2 Design and construction</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HC 3 Information requirements</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HC 4 Control systems </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HC 5 Guards and protective devices </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HC 6 Installation, operation and maintenance</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inspection of switchgear environment, for example the switchroom or substations, regularly is mandatory. During the inspection you should prioritise any remedial actions as follows:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Immediate. This should always be the case when security of the substation enclosure has been interfered with.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earliest possible opportunity.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next scheduled maintenance.

Once you have decided on the actions you will take, you must make a plan to carry them out</span></li>\n</ul>\n<strong>You decide the frequency of maintenance from factors such as:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The type of switchgear</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether it uses oil, sulphur hexafluoride or vacuum interrupters</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Its age</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How often it is operated. You should also take the maintenance history of the switchgear into account.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<strong>For the assessment of the high-voltage insulation by using partial discharge measurement techniques and the evaluation of available test data and relevant standards, you need to consider the:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Condition of the secondary wiring, protection and control equipment</span></li>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interlocking and earthing arrangements in relation to current safety standards</span></li>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Short-circuit ratings</span></li>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Venting arrangement (where appropriate)</span></li>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rating of the existing (fixed) equipment </span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The availability of spares plays a role in the decision process. You should make sure that both strategic items (eg bushings, current transformer chambers, cable boxes, operating mechanisms) and routine maintenance items (eg arcing contacts, turbulator inserts, gaskets, tripping and closing coils) are available. Do this by contacting the original equipment manufacturers, their successor companies (if the manufacturer is no longer trading) or small specialist engineering companies. Only then can you evaluate refurbishment/retrofit of the switchgear versus replacement.</span>\n<h2><strong>Methodology for Hv Switchgear Risk and Hazard Assessment</strong></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are no risk assessment guidelines available explicitly for HV switchgear. Annex 1, Principal Elements of the Safety Objectives for Electrical Equipment, of Directive 2006/95/EC relating to electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits1]   Annex A, C and D of IEC Guide 116 [2] Guidelines for safety related risk assessment and risk reduction for low voltage equipment.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The switchgear assemblies are manufactured to international standards, e.g. of the IEC 62271 series where design, construction and testing requirements rule out hazards or reduce them adequately. Hence this assessment does not carry out further evaluations if a hazard is already covered by the standard. Furthermore, the hazard assessment of HV switchgear assemblies does not cover effects and/or consecutive faults, caused by the switchgear, on the power, auxiliary and/or communication networks to which the switchgear is connected. And it does not cover effects on the electrical operating area where the switchgear is installed. It concentrates on the possible hazards that the equipment itself may pose to any person in contact with this equipment</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of the high energy levels and high voltages involved, there will always be potential hazards involved in working with medium voltage (MV) switchgear. The design and construction of MV switchgear has an important influence on its susceptibility to these arc-related accidents. Most modern switchgear is, in fact, internally arc tested, which means that should an arc fault occur, its effects are contained within the enclosure. Even in the best of equipment, however, arc-related hazards cannot be entirely eliminated. For this reason, it is important the risks are properly assessed and appropriate protective measures put in place.</span>",

        "content": "The purpose of an energy audit also known as energy assessment or energy study is to find out why, where, how and when is energy utilised in a facility, and to discover occasions to increase efficiency. Energy auditing services are provided by energy services companies, energy experts and engineering organisations. The energy auditor directs the audit process but functions watchfully with staffs, building owners and other key participants all the way through to make sure precision of data collection and correctness of energy efficiency suggestion.\n<h2>Why is Energy Auditing Done?</h2>\nWith the rising energy expense, you facility or business might be in jeopardy if sufficient action isn’t taken and you keep guessing the energy use versus financial plan equation. Energy audits helps to find out where you are throwing away energy in your facility. Domestic and industrial properties account for around 15% of carbon emissions in the UAE, according to the EPA, which means they are uneconomical and inefficient. Carelabs is there to guide you on which techniques are beneficial for decreasing energy waste and overall energy expenditure.\n\nWhen considering energy, a smaller amount is always applauded. Less energy utilisation equals less energy expense. And, also, less energy utilization is clearly worthy for the environment.\n<h2>What is Done During Energy Auditing?</h2>\nSimilar to any other audits, energy audit will evaluate all of your facility’s energy usage and sketch all of the details. It is a procedure that assists you to check where your property is wasting energy and what actions you can take to increase energy efficiency. An energy audit is something that all facilities must undergo every two to three years in order to make sure utmost efficiency and expenditure.\n\n<strong>There are three phases in an audit based on the requirements of the client:</strong>\n<h3>Investigation Phase</h3>\n<strong>This phase is about getting all the information concerning:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Historical energy consumption for the past 1 to 2 years</li>\n \t<li>Tariffs and related energy supply contracts</li>\n \t<li>Floor areas, staff numbers, production levels</li>\n \t<li>Occupancy hours</li>\n \t<li>Industry energy use/cost benchmark levels</li>\n \t<li>Sub electrical and gas metering equipment</li>\n \t<li>After-hours air conditioning usage</li>\n \t<li>Mechanical plant configuration, as-installed drawings, electrical single line drawings, and operational &amp; maintenance manuals</li>\n \t<li>Lighting configuration, condition and controls</li>\n \t<li>Compressed air system including rating, presence of air leaks, hours of usage</li>\n \t<li>Steam and hot water boilers</li>\n \t<li>Building Management Systems and control strategies</li>\n \t<li>Building envelope, shading, orientation, insulation levels</li>\n \t<li>Energy management process and policy information</li>\n \t<li>Asset management plan, if any</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Monitoring Phase</h3>\nThis phase is about getting data related to the entire site and the main energy usage groups. The function of main plant and gear is checked, and measurement of a scale of parameters i performed where necessary, including:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Electrical &amp; gas load profiles</li>\n \t<li>Internal temperature/humidity</li>\n \t<li>Ventilation rate</li>\n \t<li>Light levels</li>\n \t<li>Boiler flue combustion analysis</li>\n</ul>\nResponse is also attained from maintenance workers on subjects regarding building and plant functioning and repairs which could be affecting energy efficiency as well as causing inhabitant discomfort.\n<h3>Analysis and Reporting Phase</h3>\nThis is about:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Finding out complete energy efficiency of facility</li>\n \t<li>Finding out the greenhouse emission index(GEI) and ABGR energy star rating for office structures</li>\n \t<li>Life cycle cost analysis of various energy saving measures</li>\n \t<li>Tariff analysis</li>\n \t<li>Top demand management including assessment of power factor correction</li>\n \t<li>Noted down and if required, verbal report on results</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How is Energy Auditing Performed?</h2>\n<h3>Preliminary review of utility data</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Inspect equipment lists, utility data, building diagrams, and other property information</li>\n \t<li>Auditor gathers and review at least 2 years of utility data during the energy use analysis to account for seasonal variations and patterns of energy use (Monthly utility bill data is most commonly used)</li>\n \t<li>All forms of energy (electricity, gas, oil, water) should be included in this analysis</li>\n \t<li>From this evaluation, your facility’s Energy Utilization Index (EUI) value (annual energy use/square footage) and energy end uses (energy used by each building system) are calculated</li>\n \t<li>The Energy Utilization Index (EUI) and base energy load allow the auditor to target this data against energy usage of similar buildings and systems to show the magnitude of energy efficiency options and give an early estimate of potential savings</li>\n \t<li>Auditor also checks for the difference in usage of energy with time and reasons for the same</li>\n \t<li>Auditor will give an initial report which contains a summary of information and graphs and other visuals to permit easy interpretation.</li>\n \t<li>Outcomes from the study is used in determining which level of audit to run and get data for the final report</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Site Assessment</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>First auditor will do a physical valuation of your property and its function</li>\n \t<li>The energy auditor will also conduct a visual inspection and inventory of the building’s key elements</li>\n \t<li>Construction details of the building envelope (e.g. walls, roof, windows, doors and related insulation values)</li>\n \t<li>An inventory of the heating and cooling systems (HVAC) capacities and rated efficiency</li>\n \t<li>Manual, time clock or automated HVAC control methods</li>\n \t<li>Lightning systems and control (both interior and exterior)</li>\n \t<li>Service hot water systems</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Data Analysis</h3>\nAfter the energy auditor has collected the necessary data for your building, they will begin the energy and cost analysis. Before starting the analysis, the energy auditor should have a good understanding of your economic methodology and business criteria to ensure that the analysis is fairly compared with other investment opportunities and that cash flows match expectations.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Energy analysis</strong> methodologies vary widely. Your project goals should inform the analysis methodology selected to avoid results that yield too much or too little detail. Typical analysis methodologies include spreadsheet analysis based on engineering formulas that account for variations in time of day and season, and whole-building hourly energy use analysis for larger buildings or buildings with complex mechanical systems.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Cost analysis</strong> considers current energy costs, measure implementation costs and potential savings over time help to determine practicality and priority of Energy Efficient Mortgage (EEM) recommendations. You must give the economic method that auditor will consider for determining order of EEM implementation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Audit Report</h3>\nAudit report will constitute of sufficient data to let you make updated decisions about next stages to tally your energy savings and financial aims.\n\n<strong>Audit reports consists of detailed descriptions including:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>An catalogue of all current gears, a record of your property’s current state and energy utilisation</li>\n \t<li>A list of suggested low-cost, no-cost, and longer-term EEM suggestions depending on studies of historical energy usage and the onsite evaluation</li>\n \t<li>Existing conditions and recommended changes, including equipment specs and specific locations of installations</li>\n \t<li>How the measure will save energy and how much energy it will save</li>\n \t<li>Financial analysis outcomes i.e. expenses of suggested measures</li>\n \t<li>Effects on maintenance and comfort</li>\n</ul>\nThe report should also present optimized bundles of measures, where shorter payback EEMs are combined with longer payback EEMs to collectively meet energy savings and financial goals. This may be of particular interest if your facility has significant deferred maintenance items.\n<h2>Benefits of Energy Auditing</h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>It helps reduce energy costs in your facility</li>\n \t<li>With a reduction in production costs, the competitiveness of your company will be improved</li>\n \t<li>It helps reduce the dependence on foreign energy sources</li>\n \t<li>It helps reduce environmental damage and pollution</li>\n \t<li>It can increase the security of your energy supply</li>\n \t<li>It can reduce the consumption of natural resources</li>\n \t<li>It can reduce damage to the environment associated with the exploitation of resources</li>\n \t<li>It helps reduce the impact of greenhouse gas emissions</li>\n</ul>",

        "content": "When any electrical system becomes unsuccessful in meeting its objective, the facility should undergo checking to examine the fault, find the root, and perform remedial steps. The aim of electrical distribution system is to sustain correct functioning of the loads. The quality of electric circuit it’s the main cause or improper functioning of the load. In case it is used for troubleshooting or to get marginal data, calculating/studying electrical system components is known as power quality analysis.\n<h2>Why is Power Quality Analysis Done?</h2>\nPower quality is one of the major critical topics in industrial facilities as well as one of the major untapped zone of expense reduction and economic gain in today's businesses. Improper wiring, incorrect grounding, unbalanced loads or improperly protected equipment most likely will send electrical noise through the system and can compromise power quality. The rising necessities on guidance, monitoring, and functioning in current power systems has made power quality monitoring a familiar exercise for facilities.\n<h3>Aim of Power Quality Analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The analysis of inconsistencies between load and the system</li>\n \t<li>The assessment of the electric environment at a part of the facility in order to improve modelling methods or to build up a power quality reference</li>\n \t<li>The forecast of future functioning of load equipment or power quality diminishing equipment</li>\n \t<li>Improve Power Factor &amp; system efficiency</li>\n \t<li>Avoid Break-downs &amp; production Interruptions</li>\n \t<li>Avoid excess Energy consumption</li>\n \t<li>Remove Harmonics, Surges &amp; Transients from electrical Network</li>\n \t<li>Avoid Voltage/frequency fluctuations &amp; PLC Hang-up</li>\n \t<li>Avoid Transformer overheat, Capacitor burst, Trip Etc.</li>\n \t<li>Savings in Energy Bills due to reduced Losses &amp; KVA demands</li>\n \t<li>Increased Production Quality as a result of decreased interruption</li>\n \t<li>Enhanced Life cycle of Electrical network &amp; component</li>\n \t<li>Maximize Plant distribution Capacity</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is Done During Power Quality Analysis?</h2>\n<strong>Signs of poor power quality are:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Motor Burnout and Downtime</li>\n \t<li>Controls/Displays, Memory Loss and Downtime</li>\n \t<li>Power Factor Problems and High Utility Penalties</li>\n \t<li>Transformers Failing and Downtime</li>\n</ul>\nEach of these problems are caused by different factors. Shared infrastructure is one of the causes. Higher the state of the error, the larger the people affected, or a setback on one customer’s facility may result in a temporary influence on customers on the same subsystem. Other glitches, like harmonics, rises within customer’s system and might spread onto the network and thus affects other customers. Harmonic faults can be handled by a mashup of proper design practice and verified tools.\n<h3>Following parameters are what describes the quality of power:</h3>\n<strong>Data Collection and Power System Measurements\n</strong>These values are taken at different locations all through the property to allow precise modelling of harmonic sources.\n\n<strong>Following measurements are taken:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>System Voltage RMS</li>\n \t<li>System Current RMS</li>\n \t<li>Active &amp; Reactive Power</li>\n \t<li>Power Factor (Instantaneous)</li>\n \t<li>Data collection from site</li>\n \t<li>Harmonic measurements along with specific harmonic filtering at normal operating conditions</li>\n \t<li>Voltage Improvement &amp; stability study</li>\n \t<li>Three phase balancing study</li>\n \t<li>Surge &amp; Transient Protection, study</li>\n \t<li>KVA Capacity Release</li>\n \t<li>Broadband Harmonic reduction requirement if any</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Harmonic Analysis\n</strong>This includes the usage of computer programs to recognise and forecast possible harmonic problems and reduction methods.\n\n<strong>Surges &amp; Transient Analysis\n</strong>This analysis will record the transient and surges.\n\n<strong>Voltage Dips Swells Analysis\n</strong>This analysis will record the small term fall &amp; rise along with value and route.\n\n<strong>Reactive Power Analysis\n</strong>This analysis will calculate the preferred reactive power at distribution &amp;load end.\n\n<strong>Captive Power Analysis\n</strong>This analysis will calculate and synchronise the captive power so as to cater to demands and decrease utility surcharge and fuel consumption.\n\n<strong>Load Flow Analysis\n</strong>This analysis predicts power flow magnitudes, power factor, voltage levels, and losses in branches of the system based on the specified operating conditions.\n<h2>How is Power Quality Analysis Done?</h2>\nIEEE Power Quality Standards and NFPA 70B are outstanding assets to assist identify power quality terms, errors, and remedial actions. The equipment utilised to obtain actual readings and also gather information for downloading to computers for study and analysis is called Power Quality Analysers. Though some are permanently installed in the distribution system, handheld analysers are also used for numerous applications, mainly troubleshooting.\n\n<strong>Always follow manufacturer guidelines for setting up the analyser or else following faults may occur:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Failure to observe current polarity.</li>\n \t<li>Not matching current/voltage probes.</li>\n \t<li>Relying on battery power to complete a lengthy monitoring session.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Steps in Power Quality Analysis are:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The aim of the survey is noted down that will be utilised al through the survey</li>\n \t<li>Proceed with a correct one-line diagram of the electric system of the site.</li>\n \t<li>Analyser is connected carefully at a particular location in the distribution system end of the main breaker that will regulate incident energy levels to satisfactory range.

        "content": "In power system protection relay and circuit breakers is the major instrument for large interconnected power system. We need proper protection to isolate the faulted region from healthier network. When two protective apparatus installed in series have certain characteristics, which provide a specified operating sequence, they are said to be coordinated or selective. Relay coordination is an important aspect in the protection system design as coordination schemes must guarantee fast, selective, and reliable relay operation to isolate the power system faulted sections.\n<h2>Why is Relay Coordination Study and Analysis Performed?</h2>\nRelay coordination study and analysis is performed to make sure that safety operation of the system are functioning correctly and to avoid the nuisance tripping, as protection is a major concern in any industry and they rely on protective devices for the same. The reason for nuisance tripping is modification of protective devices and their settings at the time of upkeep without performing suitable study and analysis.\n\nThe aim of a coordination study is to determine the characteristics, ratings, and settings of overcurrent protective devices which will ensure that minimum unfaulty load is interrupted when protective devices isolate a fault or overload anywhere in the system. A coordination study should be conducted\n<ul>\n \t<li>In the early planning stages of a new system to tentatively select protection and utilization equipment</li>\n \t<li>In the case where an existing system is modified and new loads are installed</li>\n \t<li>When existing equipment is replaced with higher rated equipment</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is Done During a Relay Coordination Study and Analysis?</h2>\nANSI / IEEE Std. 242 – 1986 (Recommended Practice for Protection and Coordination of Industrial and Commercial Power System) is the standard used for this study.\n\nMostly relay coordination study and analysis is computer aided. There are several computer programs available for the protection coordination analysis of power system applications. Such programs include short circuit analysis and device time current characteristics. The main purpose of the protective coordination software is to produce one-line diagrams, calculation of relay settings and time current coordination drawings. Software will contain features to model various protective devices, equipment damage curves and store the data for future use. Using the software, the device characteristics can be called from the library and used for the coordination studies.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Personal computer</strong> - either stand alone or connected to a network with sufficient memory is needed for this type of application. Also, a good graphical monitor and laser quality printer is required. By performing the study on a personal computer, several alternatives can be examined before arriving at the final solution. The data can be stored in the computer for future use or verification of the calculations. The one-line drawings, TCC and the output can be printed for a report. Alternatively, these files can be copied and pasted in word processing documents.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Graphical display</strong> - The one-line diagram of the electrical circuit and the device coordination curves can be displayed on the graphical monitor for demonstration. Such a display helps to identify the necessary corrections to be performed before getting a printout of the diagrams or graphs.</li>\n \t<li><strong>One-line diagram</strong> - A one-line diagram of the electrical circuit for which the coordination is performed is always needed for report preparation. The software can be used to prepare the one-line diagram with the necessary devices shown. Such an approach eliminates the need to deal with the drawing office support for the protection study.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Project data files</strong> - A database is a method of storing digital data. The database can be structured to store all the necessary device characteristics, short circuit data and coordination data. These programs can perform calculations of the inrush current, device settings and project details. The project data can be copied from one computer to another for analysis.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Device library</strong> - These programs are equipped with a large library of data from various manufacturers. The library includes models for overcurrent relays, ground relays, static trip breakers, moulded case circuit breakers, data for cable damage curve, and data for transformer damage curve, motor overloads and reclosers.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Interactive data entry</strong> - It is not always possible to have the data available from the device library for the selected study. If the data are not available and if the equation or graphical data are available, then the data can be entered interactively. The data points can be entered item by item and can be saved for future use.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How is Relay Coordination Study and Analysis Done?</h2>\n<h3><strong>One-Line Diagram</strong></h3>\nIf the study is on a new system or already existing system, attain or create a one- line diagram of the system or the part of the system concerned. The diagram should show the following data:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Apparent power and voltage ratings as well as the impedance ratings and connections of all transformers.</li>\n \t<li>Normal and emergency switching conditions.</li>\n \t<li>Nameplate ratings and sub-transient reactance of all major motors and generators as well as transient reactance of synchronous motors and generators, plus synchronous reactance of generators.</li>\n \t<li>Conductor sizes, types, and configurations.</li>\n \t<li>Current transformer ratios.</li>\n \t<li>Relay, circuit breaker and fuse ratings, characteristics, and ranges of adjustment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Short Circuit Study</h3>\nObtain or perform a complete short-circuit study providing momentary and interrupting ratings. It must also contain highest and lowest anticipated fault interrupting duties, as well as inputs from every single short-circuit current source. Gather time--current characteristic curves for each protective device under consideration.\n<h3>Current Scale Selection</h3>\nBecause the whole aim of the study is to attain time-sequenced tripping of overcurrent protective equipment, the characteristic curve of the device closest to the load is plotted as far to the left of a 4- by 4-cycle graph as possible so that the source side characteristic curves are not packed to the right of the paper. The highest short-circuit current of the system is the right-hand limit of the curves.\n<h3>Characteristic Curves</h3>\nPlot on the time-current, Iog-log paper the fixed and continuous points of all electrical devices under consideration. In the process of plotting the time-current characteristic curves, it must be remembered that all currents must be referred to a common voltage, either primary or secondary, before attempting to determine coordination. On a delta-wye system, the current that the primary fuse sees due to a secondary fault depends on the type of fault, as well as the severity of the fault.\n<h3>Selective Coordination</h3>\nThe time-current characteristic curves of protective devices should not overlap if selective coordination is to be achieved, nor should the primary device of the transformer trip on inrush. The protective equipment should be set to defend motors, cables and system gear from overlay as well as short-circuit states.",

        "description": "The grounding grid analysis began with the theoretical or experimental analysis based on which different authors rendered rough expressions.",
        "content": "Since many years, i.e. from the start of high voltage power station development, the grounding grid analysis began with the theoretical or experimental analysis based on which different authors rendered rough expressions. These expressions were carried out on a single horizontal or vertical grounding rod. With the knowledge obtained from the behaviour of single vertical or horizontal grounding rod, different authors suggested additional approximate analytical representations for the grounding grids. Proposed analytical expressions had different restrains regarding dimensions and geometry of the grounding grid. It became clear that all these empirical formula have considerable drawbacks when applied to the complex geometry grounding grid.\n<h2>Why is Grounding Grid Design Analysis and Study Necessary?</h2>\nThe aim of a ground grid design is to limit electric shock related accidents. The circumstances leading to the shock accidents are:\n<ul>\n \t<li>High fault current to ground.</li>\n \t<li>Large soil resistivity.</li>\n \t<li>Existence of a person connecting 2 points of large potential difference.</li>\n \t<li>Lack of adequate contact resistance or other series resistance to regulate current through the body to a safe value.</li>\n \t<li>Time duration of the fault and body current for an adequate time to cause harm at the given current intensity.</li>\n</ul>\nThe grounding system can be designed such that the step and touch voltages are kept within the calculated safe limits.\n\n<strong>The benefits of this study include:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Design time savings</li>\n \t<li>Material cost savings by determining the minimum size of conductors and number of ground rods to keep the potential values below the IEEE limits.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is Done During Grounding Grid Analysis and Study?</h2>\n<strong>The analysis contains of these steps:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Inspection of soil characteristics.</li>\n \t<li>Calculation of peak ground current.</li>\n \t<li>Initial design of the ground system.</li>\n \t<li>Determination of resistance of the ground system.</li>\n \t<li>Determination of step voltages at the margin.</li>\n \t<li>Determination of internal step and touch voltages.</li>\n \t<li>Fine-tuning of preliminary design.</li>\n</ul>\nDue to the fact that grounding grid is buried in the earth, its mathematical treatment occupied prominent position from the very beginning of the grounding grid analysis. Hence, various soil interpretation techniques have been surveyed as well. They are basically concerned with the problems associated with a boundary between soil and air. While speaking with techniques adapt for the transient grounding grid behaviour, one needs to distinguish three very different approaches:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Circuit approach:</strong> It is said to be fast and relatively easy to understand, but at the same time least accurate.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Electromagnetic approach:</strong> Main difficulty in applying electromagnetic approach stems from the complex mathematical apparatus, which transforms Maxwell equations in system of algebraic equations, and its associated numerical implementation. Here one can distinguish between finite element approach, boundary element approach and approach according to the method of moments.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Hybrid approach:</strong> It is a synergy between the two above mentioned approaches and can vary in complexity as well as in accuracy.</li>\n</ul>\nFrom the point of view of problem formulation, methods could be regarded as a\n<ul>\n \t<li>Differential problem formulation</li>\n \t<li>Integral method</li>\n \t<li>Integro-differential method</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How is Grounding Grid Analysis Done?</h2>\n<strong>Following steps are performed during the analysis procedure:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Soil resistivity: The potential rise of a grounding system during ground fault conditions is directly proportional to the resistance of the grounding system. Resistance of the grounding system is also important for the satisfactory operation of over current devices. Hence, it is essential to predict the resistance of the grounding system before its actual installation</li>\n \t<li>Effect of voltage gradient: The ground resistance is not affected by the voltage gradient unless it is greater than 103 Volts/cm. When this value is exceeded, arcs will start at the electrode surface and progress into ground so as to increase the effective size of the electrode which the soil can withstand.</li>\n \t<li>Effect of moisture: The resistivity of the soil rises abruptly when the moisture content falls below 22% by weight. It is therefore necessary that the electrode system should be buried deep enough to ensure contact with permanently moist soil. Where this is not possible, greater dependence will usually be placed on a well distributed system of vertical rods bonded to the ground grid and reaching deep layers.</li>\n \t<li>Effect of temperature: Resistivity of soil rises abruptly when the temperature falls below 32°F. The ground grid electrode system should extend below the frost line wherever feasible to minimize seasonal variation of the grounding system resistance. Further, the overall resistance of the ground grid varies with season due to the summer and winter temperature variations.</li>\n \t<li>Determination of maximum ground fault current: The following steps are involved in determining the maximum grid current Ig for use in substation grounding calculations:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Assess the type and location of those ground faults that are likely to produce the greatest flow of current between the grounding grid and surrounding earth producing the greatest rise in grid potential with respect to remote earth.</li>\n \t<li>Calculate the fault current division factor Sf for each of the faults selected and establish the corresponding values of symmetrical grid current Ig.</li>\n \t<li>For each fault, based on its duration time, determine the value of decrement factor to allow for the effects of asymmetry of the fault current wave.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li>Conductor size: The conductor should have sufficient conductivity so that it will not contribute substantially to dangerous local voltage differences. Usually the conductor size is selected based on standard annealed soft copper wire with brazed joints on ambient temperature (Ta) of 40°C and maximum temperature (Tm) of 450°C. Knowing the magnitude of the current and time duration the required conductor area can be evaluated.</li>\n \t<li>Ground grid potentials: The step voltage, the touch voltage and the ground grid potential rise are evaluated for each substation grid. Equations are used to calculate the step, touch and mesh voltages which include geometric factors Km (for touch and mesh voltage) and Ks (for step voltage). A grid irregularity factor Ki is also incorporated into the step.</li>\n \t<li>Design of ground grid system: The design of a grid will start with an inspection of the layout plan for equipment and structures. A continuous cable should surround the grid perimeter to enclose the area as to avoid current concentration. Within the grid, the conductors are laid in parallel lines at uniform spacing. The conductors should be located along rows of structures or equipment.</li>\n \t<li>Calculation of ground grid resistance: The ground grid resistance can be calculated by use of the following equation of the ground grid equivalent to a flat circular plate.</li>\n \t<li>Refinement of ground grid design: Throughout the calculations a reduced value of the coefficient Ki is used on the premise that the user will reinforce external comers of the grid with additional conductors. A higher current density occurs in the perimeter conductors and at corners leading to higher potential gradients. By using a closer grid spacing at corners, potential gradients are lowered and using a closer grid spacing at corners can substantiate a reduction in the value of Ki.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Computer Aided Analysis</h2>\nThere are several programs available to perform the grounding grid analysis or design. These programs analyse the substation grounding grid design, given the total electric current injected into the grid. The grounding grid can be single or multiple structures. A multiple grounding structure can be two or more embedded system of conductors, which are not electrically connected.\n\n<strong>The required data for the program for the analysis include the following:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The soil resistivity at the substation location.</li>\n \t<li>Geometry of the grounding system.</li>\n \t<li>Specification of the body current calculations.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>The output of the program contains the following:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Allowable step voltage.</li>\n \t<li>Allowable touch voltage.</li>\n \t<li>Calculated step voltage.</li>\n \t<li>Calculated touch voltage.</li>\n \t<li>Ground grid resistance.</li>\n \t<li>Ground grid or mesh voltage rise.</li>\n \t<li>Body currents.</li>\n \t<li>Potential profiles.</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "The effects of extensive voltage imbalances on power systems and equipment are broad and serious. A severe imbalance might dramatically decrease the equipment life cycles, considerably speed up the replacement cycle of equipment",
        "content": "Electrical equipment like motors will not function consistently on unbalanced voltages in systems. Usually, the variance between the maximum and the minimum voltages must not surpass four percent of the lowest voltage. Larger unbalances may lead to overheating of components, particularly motors.\n<ul>\n \t<li>A three phase equipment such induction motor with unbalance in its windings.</li>\n \t<li>Any large single phase load, or a number of small loads connected to only one phase cause more current to flow from that particular phase causing voltage drop on line.</li>\n \t<li>Switching of three phase heavy loads results in current and voltage surges which cause unbalance in the system.</li>\n \t<li>Unequal impedances in the power transmission or distribution system cause differentiating current in three phases.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why is Voltage Imbalance Study Important?</h2>\nThe effects of extensive voltage imbalances on power systems and equipment are broad and serious. A severe imbalance might dramatically decrease the equipment life cycles, considerably speed up the replacement cycle of equipment, and significantly increase system operation and maintenance costs. Furthermore, for a 3 phase 4 wire system, voltage imbalance leads to bigger neutral wire current and cause relay malfunction.\n\nVoltage imbalances will create extra power loss, reduce system efficiency, decrease motor life cycles, etc. Also few abnormal functioning and maintenance circumstance also causes voltage imbalance and result in negative effects on equipment and systems. These conditions include such problems as bad electrical contacts, unsuitable shunt capacitor bank installation, single-phase operation of a motor, etc. These kinds of operation and maintenance conditions may not occur frequently. However, if they do occur they will bring about very serious problems for systems or equipment\n<h3>The major effects of voltage imbalance are described as follows:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Extra power loss</li>\n \t<li>Safety deficiency</li>\n \t<li>Motor failure</li>\n \t<li>Life cycle decrease</li>\n \t<li>Relay malfunction</li>\n \t<li>Inaccurate Measurement</li>\n \t<li>Transformer failure</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is Done During Voltage Unbalance Study?</h2>\nBecause voltage unbalance can be very harmful to electrical equipment, the source of the problem should be thoroughly investigated and corrected. By tallying the voltage it can assist put aside money and energy by improving gear efficiency and possibly avoiding costly facility interruption because of its failure. Proper testing and communication with the utility can help locate and resolve the problem.\n<h3>Main objective of this study is:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>To determine the causes and effects of voltage unbalance on the distribution system and in user facilities.</li>\n \t<li>To determine the accepted definitions for calculating voltage unbalance and to clarify the related standards.</li>\n \t<li>To identify mitigation techniques for the distribution system and for industries.</li>\n</ul>\nVoltage imbalance percentage can be calculated using this formula:\n\n<strong>% Unbalance= [Maximum deviation from average / Average of 3 phase to phase voltages]*100</strong>\n\nTo calculate the percentage deviation in three phases:\n\n<strong>[Max (Im-Ir)(Im-Iy)(Im-Ib)*100] / Im</strong>\n\nWhere, Im is mean of currents in three phases\n\n<strong>Im= (Ir+Iy+Ib)/3</strong>\n\nIr, Iy, Ib are phase currents.\n\nBesides, an unbalance can also be measured by matching the strength of positive sequence currents in comparison to the negative sequence currents. The permissible limit in terms of percentage of negative phase sequence current over positive sequence current is 1.3% ideally but acceptable upto 2%.\n<h2>How is Voltage Imbalance Study Done?</h2>\nThis study performed a comprehensive analysis of the issue of voltage unbalance on the power system. It will help utilities and industries understand the causes, effects, and definitions of voltage unbalance, identify mitigation techniques, and interpret related standards.\n\nSeveral practical cases are taken into account to deal with voltage imbalances. The simulation results with problem defined and improvement measures will be later carried out based on the results from these cases. Few examples of these cases are:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Bad connection of neutral wire</li>\n \t<li>Neutral wire broken</li>\n \t<li>Operation of three-phase motor under voltage imbalance</li>\n \t<li>Unsuitable capacitor bank installation</li>\n \t<li>Effects of Voltage Unbalance on Machines</li>\n \t<li>Effects of Voltage Unbalance on Power Electronic Converters and Drives</li>\n</ul>\nSuch cases will be used to confirm the impacts of voltage imbalance on systems and equipment. Voltage imbalance not only causes extra energy loss, but also causes safety problems for a system. To prevent voltage imbalance, the balance problem should be taken into account through all the planning, design, installation and operation stages. This study will provide details, with theoretical analysis and explanation, to make it easy to grasp the impacts of voltage imbalance on systems and equipment. The results are of value to engineers for better design, operation and maintenance of power distribution systems\n<h2>Mitigation Techniques for Facilities:</h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Unbalanced loads are the main cause of unbalanced voltages on distribution circuits and thus a great deal can be gained by attempting to distribute single-phase loads equally across all three voltage phases. Electrical distrbution systems can be balanced by changing the system configuration through manual and automatic feeder switching operations to transfer loads among circuits. This reconfiguration can be performed to reduce losses, and has the natural tendency to balance loading among</li>\n \t<li>Unbalanced impedances, including transformers and their connections, are often the next largest contributor to unbalanced voltages. Therefore, proper selection of distribution transformers is a very important step in preventing voltage unbalance, paying particular attention to the balancing of open wye and open delta transformer banks.</li>\n \t<li>If the amount of unbalance tends to vary with the customer load, it is a good possibility that the transformer is the cause of the unbalanced condition. One way to determine the transformer banks contribution to voltage unbalance is to measure the voltages on the primary and the voltages on the secondary and calculate the percent unbalance at each point.</li>\n \t<li>In addition, overload conditions on the power system should always be corrected as soon as possible for a number of protection and safety reasons as well as unbalance compensation.</li>\n \t<li>Unbalance compensation can also be achieved by means of passive power filters that balance the load impedance, where the load current is balanced by adding reactive elements in parallel to the load.</li>\n \t<li>For variable loads, voltage unbalance in ac supply systems can be corrected by means of a shunt connected thrysitor-controlled static VAR compensator, where again the load current is balanced by adding reactive elements in parallel to the load.</li>\n \t<li>Within a user facility, all overloaded equipment should be corrected. In addition, passive power filters and shunt connected static VAR compensators, for mitigation on power systems, can be used for unbalance compensation in user facilities.</li>\n \t<li>Mitigation of the adverse effects of unbalanced voltage on adjustable speed drives (ASD) can be achieved through the use of properly sized ac-line and dc-link reactors as demonstrated in. The test results showed that connecting both the ac-line and dc-link reactors to the ASD has the greatest effect on phase-current unbalance, reducing it by more than half.</li>\n \t<li>Various relays can be introduced to protect induction motors from unbalanced voltages, where the relay settings and applications depend on the motor horsepower, loading, insulation class and service factor. The negative sequence current relays are more reliable and effective because relays measuring negative sequence voltage can lack the necessary sensitivity in some system and load configurations.</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "Vibration study and analysis implies, state of a machine is identified on the basis of an analysis and study of vibration. ",
        "content": "Technicians and operators every so often notice unusual vibrations or noises on the plant or shop floor where they work daily. In order to determine if a serious problem actually exists, they could proceed with a vibration analysis. Vibration analysis implies, state of a machine is identified on the basis of an analysis and study of vibration.\n\nSuccessful application of vibration diagnosis requires in practice staff with considerable degree of knowledge and experience. Standard work of data gathering may be performed by skilled personnel without academic educations, but data assessment and processing of the machine condition is the task for an engineer who has expertise in different areas like mathematics, design of machines, dynamics, signal processing etc. and who is capable to use this expertise in context.\n<h2><strong>Why is Vibration Study and Analysis Important?</strong></h2>\nThe vibration analysis is a very important technique, in terms of mechanical vibrations for machine diagnosis. It is based on the high information content provided by the machine vibration signals that are an indicator of machine condition, used for the diagnosis of faults. Vibration analysis in a predictive maintenance program, is widely used for monitoring and detection of initial and critical faults in machinery parts, like shafts, bearings, rotors, couplings, motors etc. Some problems that are usually detected by vibration analysis are: unbalance, misalignment, bent shaft, rolling bearing faults, eccentricity, resonance, looseness, rotor rub, fluid-film bearing instabilities, gear faults, belt/sheave problems.\n\nFollowing are the reasons that makes vibration study and analysis important:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Reduces equipment costs:</li>\n \t<li>Reduces labor costs</li>\n \t<li>Reduces lost production time</li>\n \t<li>Increases safety</li>\n \t<li>Increases revenue</li>\n \t<li>Increases efficiency of employee time</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>What is Done During Vibration Study and Analysis?</strong></h2>\nThe main objectives when performing a vibration study typically fall into one or more of three categories:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Capacity</strong>: Map the dynamic behavior of the machine from current to targeted speeds, yielding the most cost-effective approach by foreseeing problems.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Rebuild</strong>:  Evaluate how rebuilds will affect the dynamic behavior of the machine and its consequences at current or increased speeds.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> Locate and eliminate vibration sources currently having a detrimental effect on the machinery or process.</li>\n</ul>\nVibration analysis is performed by Fourier transform (by its decomposition into Fourier series). All actions related to the study and analysis, given below are employed in analyzers that are utilised in vibration diagnostics.\n\nThere are different types of analyzers:  operational or laboratory, with one or more channels - but the principle of their operation is always the same.\n<h3><strong>Fourier Transform</strong></h3>\nPeriodical in time T, function x(t), can be stated as an infinite or endless progression:\n\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-5260 size-full\" src=\"http://carelabz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fourier-transform-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"553\" height=\"58\" />\n\nThis expression means that the original function x(t) can be composed from (infinite) number of sinusoids of different amplitudes, frequencies of which are multiplies of the fundamental frequency ω.\n\nCoefficients an and bn are Fourier or spectral coefficients of the function x(t) and can be computed using expressions:\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5261\" src=\"http://carelabz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fourier-transform-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"525\" height=\"55\" />\n\nDiscrete function x (t), which is defined on the set of N different instants of time tk (k = 1, N), can be written as a finite Fourier series:\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5262\" src=\"http://carelabz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fourier-transform-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"548\" height=\"62\" />\n\nFourier coefficients are usually depicted in the form of amplitude cn and phase φn:\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5263\" src=\"http://carelabz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fourier-transform-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"434\" height=\"63\" />\n\nThen, the finite Fourier series can be written as:\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5264\" src=\"http://carelabz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fourier-transform-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"467\" height=\"76\" />\n\nThis form of Fourier transform is called the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The resulting Fourier series, a set of sinusoids from which the original waveform can be composed, is called a frequency spectrum.\n\nThere is a basic relationship between the length of the sample T, the number of discrete values N, sampling (or capture) frequency fs, frequency range and spectral (or frequency) resolution. Spectrum frequency range is 0−fmax, where fmax is the Nyquist frequency and ∆f is the frequency resolution (spacing between frequency lines).\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5265\" src=\"http://carelabz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fourier-transform-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"241\" height=\"132\" />\n\nAn algorithm called Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used in up to date analyzers, where N is an integer power of number 2. In fact, the upper frequency spectral limit fmax is even more reduced in comparison with the theoretical value (e.g. for N=211=2048, only 800 frequency lines are used rather than 1024), which will be explained in the following chapter.\n<h2><strong>How is Vibration Study and Analysis Performed?</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Raw time Waveform Analysis </strong></h3>\nVibration study and analysis personnel will utilize the magnitude various signals to find out the source and nature of a problem. The most common measurement is that of vibration - in units of acceleration, velocity or displacement. Study and analysis of the raw time waveform gives helpful data for troubleshooting many issues, involving those with gearboxes. Impulsive vibration is better analyzed in the time domain.\n<h3><strong>Spectrum Analysis </strong></h3>\nThis divides the total vibration into separate frequencies so that the source of a given glitch can be easily recognized. This includes handing out the raw time domain data through a mathematical computation called the Fast Fourier Transform or FFT. The FFT algorithm converts the original signal from the time domain into the frequency domain. The outcome is that a complex signal is divided into various contributing frequencies.\n<h3><strong>Speed Trials </strong></h3>\nVariations in vibration levels as a function of varying machine loads or speeds are usually studied with the help of waterfall plots. Waterfalls, also referred to as cascade plots or spectral maps, consist of a series of spectrums placed one behind the other to generate a 3-dimensional graph. Thee Y-axis denotes vibration amplitude, the X-axis denotes Frequency and the Z-axis represents machine speed or time. Waterfalls are helpful for the determination of resonances.\n<h3><strong>Impact Testing </strong></h3>\nAim of impact testing is to recognize the natural frequencies of usually smaller components in the machine, such as doctors, tube rolls, drive shafts, showers, uhle boxes, etc. This accompaniment the speed trial as the speed trial and resulting waterfalls will denote multiple agitated natural frequencies. The following challenge for the analyst is to find out which module was really resonating as the waterfall depicts them all.\n<h3><strong>Synchronous Averaging </strong></h3>\nSynchronous averaging is utilised to separate the influence of vibration of a single rotating source. This is performed by acquiring a tachometer trigger from a prearranged felt or roll and then matching the data acquisition time absolutely with the occurrence of the trigger. When barring is a long-term problem, the system and history need to be reviewed from problem inception through to present day symptoms.\n<h3><strong>Operating Deflection Shape (ODS) Analysis </strong></h3>\nOperating deflection shape analysis depicts how a machine shifts in actual operation at particular frequencies of interest and assists find out the reason of the motion. Frequencies utilised in the study and analysis are usually multiples of running speed of the various rolls in the system. If the data used in the ODS analysis is fit to natural frequencies of the system (identified in speed trials, etc.) then the resultant model will show mode shapes instead. Understanding which modes are being agitated and the positions of largest movement allow for the most effective structural modifications.\n<h3><strong>Finite Element Analysis </strong></h3>\nFinite Element Analysis (FEA) involves the mathematical modeling of a physical system to predict the structural behavior of the system - involving geometry, material properties, boundary conditions, etc. The model is used to determine what the new natural frequencies of the system will be after structural modification is applied. The model can be as simple or extensive as required.\n<h2><strong>Following are the Different Data Acquisition Techniques:</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Online Data Acquisition and Analysis </strong></h3>\nCritical machines are almost always provided with continuous online monitoring systems. In here sensors are fit permanently on the machines at suitable positions and linked to the online data acquisition equipment. The vibration data are taken involuntarily for each position and the analysis can be showed on local monitoring equipment or can be moved to a host computer installed with database management software.\n\nThis capability allows early identification of errors and provides protective action on critical machinery.  Protective action performed by online data acquisition and analysis equipment is in form of generating alarms to caution the operators of an abnormal situation. In the case of critical error, this protective action can turn off machines involuntarily to prevent catastrophic failures. Moving the data to a host computer with database management software improves the suitability and the power of online data acquisition.\n\n<strong>Advantages </strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Performs continuous, online monitoring of critical machinery.</li>\n \t<li>Values are taken involuntarily with no human interference.</li>\n \t<li>Provides almost instantaneous detection of defects.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Disadvantages </strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Reliability of online systems must be at the same level as the machines they monitor.</li>\n \t<li>Failure can prove to be very expensive.</li>\n \t<li>Installation and analysis require special skills.</li>\n \t<li>These are expensive systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Portable Data Collectors/Analyzers </strong></h3>\nModern data analyzers give data of any vibration characteristics in any chosen engineering facility or unit. There are basically two types of data collectors and analyzers, Single channel and Dual channel.\n\n<strong>Advantages </strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Can record, collect and display vibration information like a FFT spectra, time domain waveforms and overall trend plots.</li>\n \t<li>Provides orderly collection of data.</li>\n \t<li>Automatically reports measurements out of pre-established limit thresholds.</li>\n \t<li>Can perform field vibration analysis.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Disadvantages </strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>They are relatively expensive.</li>\n \t<li>Operator must be trained for use.</li>\n \t<li>Restricted memory ability therefore information must be downloaded subsequently to collection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Handheld Vibration Meter </strong></h3>\nA handheld vibration meter is an inexpensive and simple-to-use instrument that is an essential part of any vibration program. Vibration technicians and plant operators carry handheld analyzers and meters on their periodical rounds. They provide a display of vibration levels, when these are held in contact with machinery. The readout provides immediate information that can be used to determine if the overall vibration levels are normal or abnormal. These meters are generally battery powered and utilise an accelerometer for sensing.\n\n<strong>Advantages </strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>They are convenient and flexible and require very little skill to use.</li>\n \t<li>It is an inexpensive starting point for any new condition-monitoring program.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Disadvantages </strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Limited in the type of measurements that they can perform.</li>\n \t<li>No data storage capability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Benefits of Vibration Study and Analysis</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Determination of the dynamic behavior of machine sections</li>\n \t<li>Determination of the mechanical condition of the machine</li>\n \t<li>Determination of the feasibility of a possible capacity increase</li>\n \t<li>Most cost-effective implementation of rebuilds</li>\n \t<li>Forecast future mechanical issues and reduce unintended shutdowns</li>\n \t<li>By repositioning old rolls to where they can still be utilised, we can save on roll remakes.</li>\n \t<li>Solutions to problems such as barring and gear train failures</li>\n</ul>",
